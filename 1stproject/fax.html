                        The StockTrader Indicator is heavily focused on strategy, if we cut down to its roots,you'll find this tool very handyin this 
                        extremely volatile crypto market. Many indicators are basic,linear, and very one-sided leaving no room for dynamicfunctions.  
                        Unlike most custom indicators,StockTrader weighs every single aspect into consideration before giving out a signal. Most buy/sell 
                        indicators fail because they try to apply the same strategy to every single chart, which is a very ineffective way of doing TA.

                        We wish, we could guarantee you the world, but that is impossible.StockTrader is a tool, a tool that you first have to take some 
                        time to get familiar with, get used to and understand its unique abilities. Not everyone who holds a hammer in their hands for 
                        the first time is able to one-hit the nail immediately.It comes down to the trader's ability to learn, adapt and understand 
                        Risk Management. Building a strategy around and with StockTrader will always be more profitable, than blatantly the following 
                        everything out there. If you're looking to get rich overnight, then this product is not for you.

                        forward to using alerts and automation to the full extent.
